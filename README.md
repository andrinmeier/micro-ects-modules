# Micro ECTS Modules

Micro modules is a proof of concept idea of how accredited ECTS modules could be structured in the future at universities. Instead of offering multiple AI modules that have a huge overlap the micro modules approach advocates splitting up the material into smaller sizes. The approach could be as follows:

1. The student chooses amongst a variety of micro modules for his semester plan
2. The student also has to decide on a learning goal or direction he wants to take (in the current semester and his entire degree)
3. A constraint solver checks whether all requirements are met
4. The theoretical material of the micro modules are offered in the form of online videos
5. Group projects or assignments are offered appropriately
6. Regular Q&A sessions with different professors can be held onsite or online

This approach solves the following problems:

1. Every student must fullfill the requirements
2. Students never have to endure the same material in different courses
3. Knowledge transfer in between professors since every professor must have at least a basic knowledge of all other modules (for a certain group of modules)
4. Guidance can be offered by the professors on what micro modules one should choose, but that could also be integrated into the software
5. In the end the focus should be on shifting the answer from not what the student brings with him whe he graduates but what shape of mind the student has achieved, e.g. what kind of maturity in what fields
